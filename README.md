# CandyCrush
A bot to send lives in Candy Crush

Note: this only works on Windows

1. Download Candy Crush from the Windows store and make a new account that is different from your main account (make sure Candy Crush is in full screen mode at all times to make things easier)

2. Download pycharm https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

3. Open the code in pycharm

4. The position values at the top may need some adjusting for your screen size. the positions and what they look like are below.
Note: when adjusting the (x,y) position of the coords in the code, the top left of the screen is (0,0). 
for example going right 100 units and down 200 units is a coord of (100,200).
use the pt.moveTo(pos1) line to make sure the mouse moves on top of each position by switching pos1 with pos2 and etc and running the program
delete pt.moveTo(pos1) when youre done 

5. Change numOfLives to how many lives you want to send to yourself. 

6. Run the program and make sure each button is getting pressed correctly. the sleeps in the while loop may need to be adjusted to a higher number if the auto clicker is going too fast

Note: new Candy Crush update allows you to only redeem 20 free lives from friends in one day
